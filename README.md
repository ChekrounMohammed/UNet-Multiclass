## About
This repository contains code used to train U-Net on a multi-class segmentation dataset. The code has been written in python. Inside the scripts folder, you can find all the different python files used to train, evaluate and prepare the data. The dataset that was used is the [cityscapes dataset](https://www.cityscapes-dataset.com/). More about the dataset is discussed in the consecutive sections. If you want to know how to perform image segmentation tasks in PyTorch, the visit my [text-based tutorial](https://medium.com/@mhamdaan/multi-class-semantic-segmentation-with-u-net-pytorch-ee81a66bba89) on medium.
